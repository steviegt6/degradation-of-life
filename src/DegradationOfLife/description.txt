Degradation of Life is an advanced and hyper-configurable Quality of Life solution suitable for all playthroughs!
It features a multitude of optimizations and improvements, making gameplay smooth and enjoyable.

Features:
- Made music consistent and optimized (corrected some logic behind choosing what music to play),
- entity clutter optimization (optimized the dropping of things like coins on death),
- a more immersive map that responds to changes in lighting,
- infinite buffs from potions in the inventory,
- a "player cool down" system which makes adjustments to things like respawning to feel more natural and less jarring,
- uncaps the buff limit,
- makes loot dropped by the Wall of Flesh more accessible (no more loot getting stuck in the box underground).
