Introducing Degradation of Life (DoL), the ultimate Quality of Life.
This advanced mod has many features, including (but not limited to):

Features:
- consistent and optimized music (modified code for choosing what music to play during boss fights and in biomes),
- a more immersive map (visually updates based on the time of day),
- a unique system for infinite buffs from potions in your inventory and personal banks,
- a "player cool down" system which leverages machine learning neural network models to determine the best time to respawn your player, adjusting conditions as needed to keep you excited without making the respawn times unfair,
- an entity-decluttering optimization system,
- an uncapped buff limit (more than 44 [de]buffs),
- accessible WoF loot (adjusts the spawning logic for items dropped by WoF, now it'll never get stuck in a box underground!),
- incremental optimizations by rewriting portions of the game in Rust (:rocket:) through brand new .NET-Rust-interop technology,
- 

DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A JOKE MOD, THE LISTED EFFECTS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY TRUE AND MAY HAVE ADVERSE AFFECTS ON YOUR PLAYERS AND WORLDS
BACKING UP PRIOR TO USING THIS MOD IS ADVISED (I'd recommend doing this for *all* mods).
